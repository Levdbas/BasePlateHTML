# BasePlate

BasePlate is a bare theme for WordPress that includes an up-to-date assets manager via laravel-mix/WebPack. BasePlate lends a lot of code from Sage and WordPlate. By combining these two templates a lightweight (only two files, compressed ~ 330kb, featuring full bootstrap 4 css and js and [jQuery slim](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35424053/what-are-the-differences-between-normal-and-slim-package-of-jquery)), easy to use template was created.
It ditches the full WP installation from WordPlate while maintaining the buildtools and uses core code from sage while ditching the blade template modules.

## Features

* Sass for stylesheets
* [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/mix) for compiling assets, moving images, concatenating & minifying files and last but not least, cache busting.
* [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for synchronized browser testing
* [Bootstrap 4 beta](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/)

## Installation

To use BasePlate, you need to have PHP 7.0+ installed on your machine. You'll also need a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) installed if you want to use [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/mix) to compile your CSS and Javascript and maintain your images.

Install WordPress locally on your AMP stack with a virtual hostname, create a new folder in ```wp-content/themes``` with the desired name of your template. Clone the latest version of BasePlate inside your new folder.

Next step is to set the proxy adress for BrowserSync in the webpack.mix.js file.

To install required node modules:

```bash
npm install
```
## Useage of Laravel-mix

BasePlate has integrated [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/mix) out of the box. It provides a clean, fluent API for defining basic Webpack build steps for your BasePlate template.

#### How do I use it?

Run BrowserSync and check for changes and auto-compile on the go:
```bash
npm run watch
```
During development:
```bash
npm run development
```

Enable cache busting and minifying for production use:
```bash
npm run production
```
